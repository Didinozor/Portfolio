            I am currently doing a 15-week internship at Tpcontrol, a company
            specialising in automation. I will be working on the development of
            a library of templates, dashboards and a deployment methodology
            called Zabbix, focusing on the monitoring of industrial and IT
            equipment. This project will involve defining the methodology and
            architecture, comparing Docker and bare-metal setups, and
            configuring Zabbix, including database selection and agent
            installation. I will also configure SNMP in industrial equipment and
            create Zabbix templates with items, triggers and graphs. I will also
            develop dynamic dashboards, implement security enhancements and
            manage the deployment process.

                        significant experience with this language, as it is the
                        first object-oriented language I have worked with. I am
                        confident that with more practice I will become even
                        more comfortable with this programming language.

                        This is the most recent language I learnt at school, so
                        I have less experience with it. However, this does not
                        mean I cannot work with it. In fact, as it is a
                        straightforward programming language and I have a solid
                        foundation in programming, developing and understanding
                        code comes naturally to me.

                        Learning the basics of programming started with the C
                        language, which was an essential step in understanding
                        and mastering it. I discovered how to manage code with
                        bits and bytes and understood the risks of using the
                        computerâ€™s memory to store variable data. Overall, I
                        would say that I am fairly skilled in the C language,
                        but there is always room for improvement.

                        the perfect website.
